Kernel :
-------
It is a hub of the unix operating system . 
It allocates time and memory to program and handles the response to system call

Shell:
------
This acts as an interface between the user and the kernel 

>> Every thing in a unix is a file or process
process - executing program / file - collection of data

top directory is root ( / )

Listing files:
-------------


Home >> Labs >> Day1 >>session1
    	      >> Day2 >>session2


ls >> this will give the files in the current directory
ls -R >> this will give the files in the current directory and
	 the files in side other folder s in the directory
ls -a >> this is used to display hidden files
	( <filename> this is format of hidden file)
ls ~  >> this list the details in the home path.
ls Day1/sesion  >> this is used to list files in the path 
		(make sure ur current path has the first folder(Day1)
ls - l [ long listing / directory or file ]

my current path is Day 1 ,
if I want to go to some othe path in my main folder without changing path
do the below :
ls ~/labs/day2/session2
 
Making Directory:
-----------------

mkdir Labs1  >. this will make a path in the current directory
mkdir -p /Labs/Day1/Session/Assign  >> to need multiple new path use the command -p

Changing Directory:
-------------------

cd   >>> this will change to the home directory
cd .. >> this will change to the upper parrent directory by one
cd /Labs/Day1   >> this will change to the path
cd ../.. >> this will change to the upper directory by two

printing working diretory:
--------------------------

pwd
tree Labs

Copying file:
----------------

cp file1 file2
cp ~/Labs/Day1/session1/assign1/file1.txt Labs2/  
{ full path to be mentioned , no file name means same name}
cp ~/Labs/Day1/session1/assign1/file1.txt Labs2/abc.txt
cp ~/Labs/Day1/session1/assign1/file1.txt .  [ in the home paage the path is created ]
cp file1 file1 [ does not work ]
